### Pre existing code:

Uses [Safe{Core} Plugin Template](safe-plugin-foundry-template) for boiler plate code to setup tests & deploy the plugin. The Plugin metadata code is Safe's own example [demo plugin](https://github.com/5afe/safe-core-protocol-demo/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Plugins.sol). All of the implementation & tests are written during the hackathon.
